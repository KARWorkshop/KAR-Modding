# KAR-Modding
A repo of info on KAR Modding

KAR Workshop seeks to improve the Kirby Air Ride community. As such, we are working to bring togeather existing tools and make new ones.

This is helped by people like Taco, who created some lovly tutorials on the Wiki about making mods.
- [Changing Star Values](https://kar.miraheze.org/wiki/Changing_Values_and_Attributes_with_HSDraw)
- [Model Swapping](https://kar.miraheze.org/wiki/Model_Swapping_with_HSDraw)
<br/>
and there are others.

We bundled a bunch of the tools for modding in the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/KARWorkshop/KAR-Modding/releases). Theses include ones like HSDRaw and Plugins for blender. But it also includes some of the KAR Workshop custom tools. You can also download the same bundle from the [KAR Workshop Website](https://karworkshop.com/)
